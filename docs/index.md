# operationcounter

**operationcounter** is a Python package for
**tracking arithmetic and comparison operations**. It is designed to perform
complexity analysis empirically and exactly.

Unlike profilers (which measure *time*), `OperationCounter` counts *operations*
like `add`, `iadd`, `lt`, `pow`, `divmod`, etc., giving you a cost model that
is independent of machine speed.

```python
>>> from operationcounter import OperationCounter, count_ops
>>> a = OperationCounter(3)
>>> b = OperationCounter(5)
>>> c = a * b + 2
>>> if c > 10:
...     c -= 1
... OperationCounter.counter
Counter({'mul': 1, 'add': 1, 'gt': 1, 'isub': 1})
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goessl/operationcounter.git
```

## Features

- **A class `OperationCounter`** that wraps any Python value and tracks:
    - Arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`, `divmod`
    - Bitwise operations: `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`
    - Unary operations: `+x`, `-x`, `abs(x)`, `~x`
    - Comparisons: `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`
- **Exact accumulators** that don't perform any unnecessary operations like `+0` or
  `*1` and allow for an **initial and a default argument**:
    - `reduce_default`,
    - `sum_default`,
    - `prod_default` &
    - `sumprod_default`.

## Why not just use a profiler?

Profilers measure wall-clock time or CPU usage, which depends on machine,
libraries, and optimizations resulting in machine dependent and noisy results.
`OperationCounter` instead counts *abstract operations separately* - closer to what we
use in algorithm analysis (e.g. "merge sort does $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ comparisons").

It also enables *exact counting*, so that not just a big-O result like
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ can be given but rather "this function does $n^2+3n+2$
multiplications and $4n+1$ additions".

## Demonstration

To verify that [iterative polynomial
evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method#Efficiency) takes
$n$ additions and $2n-1$ multiplications.
```python
>>> from itertools import accumulate, repeat
>>> from functools import reduce
>>> from operator import mul
>>> from operationcounter import OperationCounter, count_ops, sumprod_default
>>> 
>>> def polyval_iterative(p, x):
...     """Return the polynomial `p` evaluated at point `x`.
...     
...     Uses iterative monomial calculation.
...     """
...     #don't do
...     #return sumprod(p, accumulate(repeat(x, len(p)-1), mul, initial=type(x)(1)))
...     #as it would introduce two unnecessary multiplications and one addition:
...     # one multiplication in accumulate: 1, 1*x, x*x, x^2*x, ...,
...     # another one in sumprod: p[0]*1 + p[1]*x + p[2]*x^2 + ...
...     # and an addition in sumprod: 0 + p[0] + p[1]x + ...
...     monomials = (type(x)(1),) + tuple(accumulate(repeat(x, len(p)-1), mul))
...     return sumprod_default(p[1:], monomials[1:], initial=p[0])
...     
>>> p = [1, 2, 3] # 1+2x+3x^2
>>> x = 5
>>> 
>>> p = tuple(map(OperationCounter, p))
>>> x = OperationCounter(x)
>>> 
>>> with count_ops() as counts:
...     assert polyval_iterative(p, x) == 86
...     counts
...     
Counter({'mul': 3, 'add': 2, 'eq': 1})
```

## Warning

Special attention has to be paid to built-in functions like
[`sum`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum). It prepends an
initial `+int(0)` (to correctly return the neutral element for an empty sum)
and therefore increments the addition counter too.

For such applications **use the provided `reduce_default`, `sum_default`,
`prod_default` & `sumprod_default`**.

## Limitations

- **Only counts operations performed through the wrapper**.
  If your algorithm manipulates raw `int` or `float`, those ops are invisible.
- Does not catch operations executed inside C extensions (e.g. `numpy.linalg`).
- Uses a global counter; multi-threaded code may need thread-local storage
  (planned feature).

## Roadmap

- [x] `reduce`, `sum`, `prod` & `sumprod` with default argument.
- [ ] Accumulators as C extension.
- [ ] Log all operations with operands so that the binary complexity can be
  determined.
- [ ] Threading.
- [ ] More flexible grouping schemes (choose your own families).
- [ ] Helper to wrap elements of sequences or `numpy.array`s.
