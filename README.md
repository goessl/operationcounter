# operationcounter

**operationcounter** is a Python package for
**tracking arithmetic and comparison operations**. It is designed to perform
complexity analysis empirically and exactly.

Unlike profilers (which measure *time*), `OperationCounter` counts *operations*
like `add`, `iadd`, `lt`, `pow`, `divmod`, etc., giving you a cost model that
is independent of machine speed.

```python
>>> from operationcounter import OperationCounter, count_ops
>>> a = OperationCounter(3)
>>> b = OperationCounter(5)
>>> c = a * b + 2
>>> if c > 10:
...     c -= 1
... OperationCounter.counter
Counter({'mul': 1, 'add': 1, 'gt': 1, 'isub': 1})
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goessl/operationcounter.git
